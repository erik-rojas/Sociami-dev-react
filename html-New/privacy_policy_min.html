						processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
						subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
						provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
						operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning
						our products or services. If Soqqle is
						<!-- Changed as requested -->subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations,

			You may delete this sentence, but still GDPR will apply to any processing of the EU citizens/residents in such cases.

						Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations
						which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the
						legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third-party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
						or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations
						are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. It considered
						that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2
